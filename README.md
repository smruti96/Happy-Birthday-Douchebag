 Yaaaayyy!! So it's that time of the year :* Omprakash Sridharan! You are one amazing soul and there is nobody quite like you <3
 Yeah I used to be a bomb back in school and we barely spoke :P But it all kick-started with that friend request you sent me back in December 2014 :)
 P.S. This thing here could have had smileys but you didn't help me with that and this is gonna be one long shit! So bear with me :)))
 Starting where I left off.. Yeah the friend request :) That's the one best thing you've ever done :* It never occured to me that I'd be friends with this geeky guy from school, let alone best friends :p
 So gradually we got closer and you began to be grateful and fell for all my love and support :) Well a part of it is true :P 
 What exactly happenend was that every conversation with you felt like a step closer to home. You remedy my heart in a conversation! Time and again, you remind me the power of a good conversation- which is why I never get bored with your bullshit and am always eager to talk to you <3
 You are someone I lost myself to but never feel defeated about it! So it's kind of a win-win situation XD
 Coming across such a beautiful soul will never be enough to compare with any other happiness! Am blessed and so are your douchebag friends :)
 I guess everything is working out just fine between us cuz you're more of a best friend first- all those sarcasrtic talks and lame jokes to serious discussions about society and life talks! I could rant and talk about anything with you and you'd still listen without complaining! And that's beautiful <3
 You deserve nothing but the best! This might be th billionth time I'm saying this.. But I'm here to stay with a promise of forever!
 Happy 21 awesomeness! I wish we weren't this distant and hope that all my efforts make up for my absence. Stay happy :*
 - Out of your league Orissa girl :P
