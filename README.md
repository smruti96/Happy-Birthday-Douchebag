 Yaaaayyy!! So it's that time of the year :* Omprakash Sridharan! You are one amazing soul and there is nobody quite like you <3
 Yeah I used to be a bomb back in school and we barely spoke :P But it all kick-started with that friend request you sent me back in December 2014 :)
 P.S. This thing here could have had smileys but you didn't help me with that and this is gonna be one long shit! So bear with me :)))
 Starting where I left off.. Yeah the friend request :) That's the one best thing you've ever done :* It never occured to me that I'd be friends with this geeky guy from school, let alone best friends :p
 So gradually we got closer and you began to be grateful and fell for all my love and support :) Well a part of it is true :P 
 What exactly happenend was that every conversation with you felt like a step closer to home. You remedy my heart in a conversation! Time and again, you remind me the power of a good conversation- which is why I never get bored with your bullshit and am always eager to talk to you <3
 You are someone I lost myself to but never feel defeated about it! So it's kind of a win-win situation XD
 Nothing can ever make me as happy as coming across such a beautiful soul! You are my happiness and you know it! (This doesn't mean that you have to keep bragging about that all the time) Am blessed and so are your douchebag friends :)
 I guess everything is working out just fine between us cuz you're more of a best friend first- all those sarcastic talks and lame jokes to serious discussions about current issues and life talks! I could rant and talk about anything with you and you'd still listen without complaining! And that's beautiful <3
 You deserve nothing but the best! This might be the billionth time I'm saying this.. But I'm here to stay with a promise of forever!
 Happy 21 awesomeness! I wish we weren't this distant and hope that all my efforts make up for my absence. Stay happy :*
 - Out of your league Orissa girl :P
